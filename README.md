**ChatCPG v2** is an advanced AI-powered platform that combines intelligent chat capabilities, comprehensive knowledge management, and automated solution development using cutting-edge AI technologies.

## 🤖 Automated Development

This project uses **AI-powered automated development** through GitHub Actions. The system:

- 🔄 **Continuously develops** the application using AI agents
- 📋 **Follows a structured plan** with defined phases and tasks
- 🧪 **Tests and validates** each implementation
- 📊 **Tracks progress** and generates reports
- 🔧 **Self-commits** working code to the repository

### How It Works

1. **AI Developer Agent** reads the development plan
2. **Generates production-ready code** for each task
3. **Tests the implementation** automatically
4. **Commits successful changes** to the repository
5. **Reports progress** and handles failures

## 🎯 Project Vision

Create a comprehensive platform that enables businesses to:

- **Chat with AI** using their own knowledge base
- **Upload and process** various document formats
- **Generate automated solutions** through Cursor API integration
- **Manage subscriptions** with transparent pricing
- **Scale intelligently** with usage-based billing

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend (FastAPI)
- **Authentication**: JWT + Google OAuth
- **Payments**: Stripe integration with subscriptions
- **Knowledge Base**: Vector database with RAG
- **AI Integration**: Multiple LLM providers
- **Cursor API**: Automated code generation

### Frontend (Next.js)
