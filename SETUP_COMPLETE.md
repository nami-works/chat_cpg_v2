   - Tests and validates implementations
   - Commits successful changes automatically

2. **📋 Development Plan System**
   - Structured task management
   - Dependency tracking
   - Progress monitoring
   - Phase-based development

3. **🔄 GitHub Actions Integration**
   - Automated hourly development cycles
   - Manual trigger capability
   - Comprehensive logging
   - Automatic issue creation for failures

4. **📊 Monitoring & Reporting**
   - Real-time progress tracking
   - Development reports
   - Status badges

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Set Up API Keys
```bash
# Copy the template
cp env_template.txt .env

# Edit .env with your keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 2. Push to GitHub
```bash
# Repository already created and code pushed!
# Your repository: https://github.com/nami-works/chatcpg_v2
git remote -v  # Verify remote is set correctly
```

### 3. Configure GitHub Secrets
In your GitHub repository settings, add:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `AI_GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub personal access token (for automated commits)

### 4. Enable GitHub Actions
- Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
- Enable workflows
- The AI will start developing automatically!

## 🎮 How to Use

### Automatic Development
- **Scheduled**: Runs every hour (9 AM - 6 PM UTC, Mon-Fri)
- **Manual**: Trigger from GitHub Actions tab
- **Monitoring**: Check progress in README badges

### Local Development
```bash
cd automation
python ai_developer.py
```

### Test System
```bash
cd automation
python test_setup.py
```
